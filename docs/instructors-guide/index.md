# Instructors Guide

This section describes guidelines for people teaching STEM robotics
courses.  We don't just focus on the process of setting up a great
STEM Robotics event or course, we also review some of the underlying
processes we are attempting to teach.

## Computational Thinking

Computational thinking is a name we give to describing the underlying patterns that guide the development of computer science curriculum.  Our goal is to teach these
concepts using a fun curriculum.

## Exploration vs. Competition

When designing robotics events and programs, instructors must consider whether to emphasize competitive or exploration-based approaches. Research shows these choices significantly impact student participation, retention, and learning—particularly for girls, minorities, and disadvantaged youth.
