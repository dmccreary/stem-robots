Create a derailed course description that describes a 2-hour
hands-on course on teaching computational thinking using
a low-cost STEM robot.

The target audience for this course is teachers that have
little or no experience with coding.  The goal is to get
them exposed to the ideas of teaching computational thinking
using a fun hands-on $35 STEM robot.

The robot is built around the Cytron RP2040 Maker Pi board.
It has two DC motors and a time-of-flight sensor as well
as a 128x64 monochrome display.

The students will need to have Thonny installed on their
desktops before the class begins.

The rough outline is:

1. What is computational thinking
2. Why are fun low-cost robots the best way to teach computational thinking
3. Overview of physical computing
4. Getting started with Thonny
5. Blinking an LED
6. Changing color on a NeoPixel
7. Playing a sound
8. Driving a motor
9. Reading the distance sensor
10. Updating the display
11. Running the collision avoidance program
12. Putting your robot in the robot corral
