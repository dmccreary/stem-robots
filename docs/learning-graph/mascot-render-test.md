# Sparky - Mascot Test

This page shows all mascot images as well as the admonition styles for reference. Check that all the images have a transparent background
and do not have excessive padding around the drawing.
Note that the images have a dashed blue border around them so you can clearly see the padding.

<style type="text/css">
  img {
    border: 1px dashed blue;
  }
</style>
