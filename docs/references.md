## Introduction to Python with Trinket

This site is our most popular site for students who are new to Python programming.  This has a well-designed set of lessons that use the Trinket site which is a kid-safe place to learn Python with turtle graphics.

## AI Racing League

This project uses an RC car body with a full Raspberry Pi and camera to
teach the basics of machine learning and computer vision.  The cost of the hardware is about $300/car and we use a $900 PC with a GPU to train models.

## Robot Faces

For students who want to put faces on their robots, this is the site for you.  The site starts with learning basic drawing commands for squares and circles and then builds up to drawing complex faces with eyes, smiles and eyebrows.  You can even teach your robot to wink!
