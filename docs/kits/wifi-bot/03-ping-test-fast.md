^C
--- 10.0.0.57 ping statistics ---
7 packets transmitted, 6 packets received, 14.3% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 7.264/15.036/19.538/3.877 ms
```

Note that the average is now about 19 milliseconds!

## What We Achieved

**Before**: 3+ second delays, multiple timeouts, inconsistent performance
**After**: Consistent 7-19ms response times with just one initial timeout

## The Results Breakdown

**Single Initial Timeout**: This is normal - the very first ping packet sometimes gets lost while the network stack finishes initializing. This is much better than the multiple timeouts you had before.

**Consistent Sub-20ms Latency**: Your 7-19ms range is excellent for a microcontroller! For comparison:
- Typical PC WiFi devices on local network: 5-10ms
- Raspberry Pi Pico W: 10-30ms (now achieved!)
- Previous version: 1000-3000ms (terrible!)

**Stable Performance**: No more wake-up delays - the device stays responsive to all subsequent pings.

## Why This Worked

The `wlan.config(pm=0xa11140)` command disabled WiFi power management, preventing the chip from:
- Entering deep sleep between packets
- Taking seconds to wake up from power-saving modes
- Causing those massive latency spikes

Your Pico W is now behaving like a proper network device that's always ready to respond. This makes it suitable for applications that need reliable network connectivity, like IoT sensors, web servers, or remote monitoring systems.

Perfect for any project where you need dependable network responsiveness! üëç
