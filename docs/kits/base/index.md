This is our classic low-cost robot that can be purchased for around $19 each and can be assembled without any soldering.  It is built on the powerful
[Cytron Maker Pi RP2040] board that is programmed by the same
software that powers the Raspberry Pi Pico.

# Introduction to the Base STEM Robot

Although there are many variations of our STEM Robot, this
robot was specifically designed for classrooms that
don't want to require any soldering and complex wiring.
