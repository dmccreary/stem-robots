# Display Bot

![](../../img/display-robot.png)

One of the best ways to see what is going on in a STEM robot is to add
a small display.  One of our favorite displays is a 2.42" 128x64 OLED display.
Although it is not full color, it is large and bright enough that we can read the numbers while we are standing and the robot is on the floor.
