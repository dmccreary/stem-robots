# Enumerating Concepts

## Prompt

```linenums="0"
Given the course description in the prior section,
create a list of the 150 key concepts that must
be taught in this course.  Return a ordered list of the
concept labels with under 30 characters per label.
Use abbreviations when needed.  Order the concepts
in the order you think they should be taught.
```

## Response



## Workflow

**Identifying key concepts**

I'm tasked with identifying and listing 150 key concepts for a 14-week course on computational thinking using a STEM robot. The concepts will be ordered from foundational to advanced, spanning areas like algorithm basics, hardware fundamentals, and MicroPython essentials.

**Categorizing key concepts**

I'm mapping out a logical progression of 150 key concepts, focusing on computational thinking, MicroPython syntax, hardware, and specific functionalities like controlling LEDs, ensuring clarity and brevity.

**Mapping the course**

I'm outlining a 14-week course, categorizing concepts like computational thinking, hardware introduction, MicroPython syntax, and LED control, ensuring clarity with concise labels under 30 characters.

**Applying abbreviations**

I'm outlining a course by using abbreviations to efficiently condense key concepts, ensuring each label remains under 30 characters and maintaining clarity in the course structure.

**Mapping the curriculum**

I'm listing key concepts like computational thinking, sensors, and MicroPython syntax, ensuring labels are concise and under 30 characters to maintain clarity and progression in the course structure.

**Refining course concepts**

I'm refining course concepts, like coding LED actions, wiring sensors, and debugging, ensuring each step is clearly defined and builds upon previous knowledge, maintaining a logical progression.

**Focusing on details**

I'm honing in on advanced concepts like servo control, data smoothing, and AI classification, ensuring each label is concise and under 30 characters.
