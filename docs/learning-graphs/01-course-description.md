Please generate a detailed course description for the following course
using Bloom's 2001 taxonomy.

Create a derailed course description that describes a 14 week
hands-on course on teaching computational thinking using
a low-cost STEM robot.

The target audience for this course is students in the 9 to 12th grade
of high school that have
little or no experience with coding.  The goal is to get
them exposed to the ideas of computational thinking
using a fun hands-on $35 STEM robot.

The robot is built around the Cytron RP2040 Maker Pi board.
It has two DC motors and a time-of-flight sensor as well
as a 128x64 monochrome OLED display.  All coding
is done using MicroPython v1.24.1 using the Thonny.

The students will have access to Thonny installed on their
computer lab systems before the class begins.

The rough outline is:

1. What is computational thinking: algorithms, abstraction, decomposition and pattern matching
2. Why fun low-cost robots the best way to learn computational thinking
3. Overview of physical computing: sensors, motors, displays and controllers
5. Overview of the robot hardware (DC motor, Cytron board, Time-of-flight sensor, OLED display)
5. Getting started with Thonny: desktop, syntax of Python
6. Blinking an LED on the Cytron board
7. Changing color on a NeoPixel
8. Moving a pixel up and down a LED NeoPixel strip
9. Playing a sound
10. Driving a motor forward and reverse
12. The I2C bus
13. Reading the distance sensor
14. The SPI bus
15. Using the OLED display
16. Drawing commands (text, line, circle, polygon)
17. Drawing a chart of distance measurements
18. Running the collision avoidance program
19. Changing the collision avoidance parameters
20. Drawing a face on the robot
21. Student projects: adding sensors, breadboarding, displays, AI
22. Summary: What we have learned about computational thinking
