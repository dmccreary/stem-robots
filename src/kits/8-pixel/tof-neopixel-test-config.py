# Demo for Maker Pi RP2040 board using the VL32L0X time of flight distance sensor
# Note the driver I used came from here: https://github.com/CoderDojoTC/micropython/blob/main/src/drivers/VL53L0X.py
# Perhaps derived from here: https://github.com/uceeatz/VL53L0X/blob/master/VL53L0X.py

# This demo makes a strip of 8 NeoPixels show the distance
