## Overview

STEM Robots is a comprehensive fully customizable educational curriculum designed to teach 
computational thinking through hands-on robotics projects using affordable components. 
At just $19 per robot, this curriculum makes robotics education accessible to schools 
with any budget while providing engaging, standards-aligned learning experiences.

The curriculum progressively introduces students to programming concepts, sensors, 
actuators, and problem-solving skills using MicroPython and the Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller platform
and the low-cost but powerful $12 [Cytron Maker Pi RP2030](https://www.cytron.io/p-maker-pi-rp2040-simplifying-robotics-with-raspberry-pi-rp2040) robotics board.

## üåü Our Mission

We believe that every student deserves access to high-quality STEM education regardless of their school's budget. By combining:
- **Affordable hardware** (under $19 per robot)
- **Open-source curriculum** (freely available and customizable)  
- **Modern tools** (MicroPython, generative AI)
- **Proven pedagogy** (computational thinking, constructionist learning)

### Standardized Hardware Configuration File
Each robot kit uses a standardized `config.py` file.  You just change this file and all the labs will work!

```python
# Motor control pins (H-bridge)
RIGHT_FORWARD_PIN = 8
RIGHT_REVERSE_PIN = 9
LEFT_FORWARD_PIN = 10
LEFT_REVERSE_PIN = 11

# I2C configuration for sensors
SDA_PIN = 16
SCL_PIN = 17

# NeoPixel LEDs
NEOPIXEL_PIN = 18
NUMBER_PIXELS = 2
```
